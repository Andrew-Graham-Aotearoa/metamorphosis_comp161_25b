    <h2>Franz Kafka</h2>
    <p>
        Born in 1883, Prague of Jewish decent and trained as a lawyer.<br>
        At the time Prague was part of the Austro-Hungarian empire and later became the capital of Czechoslovakia.<br>
        He was witness to the rise of industrialisation in his life and was employed as an insurance assesor. <br>
        He was rapidly promoted to higher levels of responsibility in his role and resented this whenever it
        interfered with his literary aspirations.<br>
        Largely his writing was met with an underwhelming response during his life, and many of his works remained
        unpublished
        and in draft form at the time of his death.
        The term Kafkaesque was taken from his name and ability to encapsulate alienation and anxiety as well as portray
        bizzare and surreal situations and incomprehensible bureaucreatic difficulties.
        Kafka was deferred from service in World War 1 because of his importance to his employer, and later tried to
        enlist.
        He was denied due to his poor health. Tuberculosis would eventually end his life in 1924, aged 40.
    </p>
    <h2>The Metamorphosis</h2>
    <p>
        One of the few novels that Kafka considered finished in his lifetime <i>The Metamorhposis</i> or <i>Die
            Verwandlung</i>
        was published in 1915.
        Gregor Samsa, the protaginist awakens as a bug and cannot go to work as a result of this transformation.
        Kafka's prose is ambiguious about whether Samsa is an actual bug, or if he is suffering from some sort of mental
        break.
        He never let the publisher add a bug image when the novel was printed.<br>
        It can be percieved as literary criticism of both work, capitalism and the nature of alienation, in doing so it
        is a
        complex and multifaceted work, and regarded as a classic because of this.
        The novel is based in the family apartment and over the course of the story Gregor's plight is solidified.<br>
        At the end we understand that there has been another metamorphosis as a result of this unfortunate change.
