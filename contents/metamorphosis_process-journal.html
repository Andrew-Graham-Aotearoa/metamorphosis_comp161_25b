    <h2>Critique 01</h2>
    <p>Tasks for Week 1 and 2:<br>
    <ul>
        <li>Decide on a book</li>
        <li>Analyse Content and Gutenberg Interface</li>
        <li>Consider layout and Features</li>
        <li>Assess other E-Book Layouts</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I considered this book to be interesting because the metanarratives
        of alienation and anxiety that Franz Kafka portrays in the novel are relevent to this day.
    </p>
    <P>The short and concise nature of the work and the fact that it is centred
        almost entirely in one apartment has some interesting possibilities.

    <h2>Critique 02</h2>
    <p>Tasks for Week 3 and 4:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Sketch wireframes</li>
        <li>Consider the Site Architecture and Links</li>
        <li>Investigate Coverpage Images</li>
        <li>Begin Html Content Pages and link them together</li>
    </ul>
    <p>After sketching out a basic wireframe, I then drew it more concisely.<br>
        I then created a project in Adobe XD that enabled me to prototype
        the links in a digital space and get a feel for the coverpage look.
    </p>
    <p>I sourced a couple of different images for the coverpage, my current
        conceptual approach is to interpret the novel and its themes in a
        contemporary way. <br>
        One image is a server room, and I thought that perhaps the metamorphosis
        could be framed as though someone was lost in the virtual world. <br>
        The second image is an interpretation of a popular series, where
        workers are surgically altered so they have a partition between home
        and work. <br>
        This concept serves as an interesting metaphor for lost identity.

    <h2>Critique 03</h2>
    <p>Tasks for Week 5 and 6:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Make Typography Choices</li>
        <li>Show Work in Progress Formatting and Layout</li>
        <li>Show Current CSS File</li>
        <li>Consider Color Choices</li>
        <li>Display File Formatting and Folder Layout</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I made the decision to use Google Fonts and embed them. For the
        formatting and layout I worked backwards from Adobe XD and began
        to style the pages with CSS. It is obvious that fixed point size fonts
        will not be good for responsive, changing to Em sized fonts will be required.<br>
        My first page was called "Homepage" so I have renamed it "index" (as per industry standard)
        and reformatted the links as appropriate.<br>
        My index page at the time corresponded to the contents section.
        so I re-named this page "Contents". <br>
        I intend to use a floating sidebar menu so that I can keep navigation to a minimum, and provide a better reading
        experience.

    <h2>Project Checkpoint</h2>
    <h2>Tasks for Teaching Recess:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Continue formatting CSS</li>
        <li>Apply Colours to the Design</li>
        <li>Create Link Interactions</li>
        <li>Add Images</li>
        <li>Begin Responsive Formatting</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        I added colours and images to the project, the colours were taken from the index page "hero" image.
        I also spent timne formatting the text with Em sizes and the borders and margins as percentages.<br>
        To do this I utilized Classes and ID selectors to target specific elements.<br>
        In the "About" page I used media rules to resize the iFrame sections
        for different devices. I would like to develop these to incorporate all of the pages if there is time.<br>
        For the background of the main text portion I took a photograph of a building, imported it into
        photoshop and matched the size with an entire page screenshot of the text as is. I then cropped it and
        added some colour accents to blend with my chosen colour scheme.<br>
        <em>This image and strategy would require some rework later because the load time for the background was
            slow.</em>
    </p>
    <h2>Feedback: Project Checkpoint</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Extract the Process Journal from the "About" Page</li>
        <li>Add further details to the About section</li>
        <li>Reduce the Body text margin size and line length subsequently</li>
        <li>Develop sidebar menu to improve page navigation</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Creating a new page for the Process Journal required page duplication,
        relinking and some formatting. I searched for some more Kafka content and
        found a full Youtube video of the story with and artist drawing it.
        This was embedded as an iFrame.
    </p>
    <p>I did some research and wrote a small synopsis of the novel (without spoilers) and created a biopic about Kafka.
    </p>
    <p>The formatting of the "next" page link was changed to a lighter colour so contrast was improved.<br>
        I refined a bit of the CSS and removed some redundant and repeated code, particularly around the hover and
        clicked states.<br>
        "The End" of the story was linked to the "About" Page.
        I was tempted to link it back to "Page 1" to create a Kafkaesque confusion, but elected not to.
    </p>
    <h2>Sidebar Navigation</h2>
    <p>
        When adding the sidebar I used code from <a
            href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/tryit.asp?filename=tryhow_js_sidenav_none">W3Schools</a> and changed
        the formatting to suit.
        By moving the connected elements on the z-axis to the correct order I managed to troubleshoot the X (close) button and 
        ensure it could be clicked on. <br>
        I transposed the menu to all of the pages, except index, and added a class for the locator so that the current page was highlighted.
    </p>

    <h2>Critique 04</h2>
    <p>Tasks for Week 7 and 8:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Develop two concepts for interactive elements</li>
        <li>Begin to apply responsive principles to the pages</li>
        <li>Further utilise animations in CSS where appropriate</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I had worked out some responsive design aspects for the "About" page and class over the mid-term break. <br>
        These were not really working properly anymore because "About" and Process Journal were still the same class. The content
        was a little different on both pages. By making edits in the responsive menu of Firefox I was able to change the sizes of text
        and the margins to work at the Max 768px breakpoint, this is invaluable for troubleshooting layout issues quickly.</p>
    <p> The Menu will require some manipulation to be functional at the mobile size.<br>
        The best thing to do would be to add a solid background to the closed state and fix the Hamburger icon to the top of the
        page so that it is visible, but does not have text sliding past the opaque layers. 
        It may be a good idea to reduce the opacity of all the other page content when the menu is open.

    <h2>Feedback: Critique 04</h2>
    <p>The critique of my interactive proposal was that it was not alligned with the brief.<br>
        I needed to re-think it and come up with something better.
    <ul>
        <li> A bug wandering around the page would be acceptable as an accent, but not as a fully interactive element.</li>
        <li>The number of users will be very small because the project will remain local therefore a user poll was not a
            particularly useful or interesting interactive feature.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Interactive Idea Number 3:</h2>
    <p>
        Create a "build your own bug" feature as an interactive element.
        The user can pick parts of a bug or a human to add together and decide the number of limbs, head parts or torso. <br>
        (This was suitably interesting and worth developing).
    </p>
    <p>The process is further outlined in Critique 05.<br>
        I started out with a Wiki Commons image of Franz Kafka, which I used for the head.<br>
        My Bug was from a site that sells monster sized cockroaches as pets. <br>
        A catalogue selling 1920's style suits was the source for the remainder of the images.

    <h2>Responsive Resizing</h2>
    <p>I spent some time after completing the rest of the Journal and worked on responsive resizing using media rules. <Br>
   I consider this aspect of the project "work in progress". <br>
   Of note: the H1 in the animation section is not as elegant as I would like it to be. <br>
   On this page are 2 main fixed elements and flowing text, so reconciling this with media rules is just messy.<br>
   The most practical way to resolve this would be to utilise a flexbox at a few key breakpoints: <br>
    (1300px, 1150px, 850px, 768px), or similar.<br>
   This way the structure would be sensible and predictable. <br>
   I will not be doing this at this stage because I have no further time to dedicate to this project.<br>
   I would potentially need to debug various elements of the animation while I came to grips with how flexbox was working, and submitting a working animation is more important to me.
